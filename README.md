# Broadcast Voice Alerts with Nexmo and PHP

This repository holds the code used in the tutorial <https://developer.nexmo.com/tutorials/voice-alerts>. The idea is that for an important message, calling people rather than sending messages is more effective. This application calls multiple people, detects if the phone was answered or not and whether it was an answering machine that answered. It also asks users to confirm that they have heard the message.
